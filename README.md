[<img alt="Get it on GitHub" src="screenshots/github.png" width="200px">](https://github.com/YangDai2003/Kori/releases)

To balance the account fees of the app store, the app will be sold at a very low price. You can also
get it for free from GitHub. The app itself is no different. Thank you for your support and
understanding.

## ✨ Key Features

Kori is packed with features designed to enhance your productivity and creativity:

* **✍️ Multi-Format Support**: Unleash your ideas with comprehensive support for various formats,
  including _Drawing_, _Markdown_, _TXT_, _LaTeX_, _Mermaid_ diagrams, and organized _Todo.txt_
  lists.

* **💻 Truly Cross-Platform**: Enjoy a unified experience whether you're on _Android_, _iOS_,
  _Windows_, _macOS_, or _Linux_. A _Web_ version is also planned for the future.

* **🤖 Intelligent & Optional AI Co-writer**:
    * Boost your writing with deeply integrated AI capabilities for content generation,
      summarization, rewriting, and more.
    * Connect to a wide range of large language models (LLMs) from providers like _Google_,
      _OpenAI_, _Anthropic_, and _DeepSeek_ using your own API keys.
    * Flexibly use self-hosted models (e.g., _Ollama_, _LMStudio_) by configuring the base URL.
    * All AI features are entirely optional. **You can completely disable all AI functionalities**.

  ** at a glance.

  time formatting.

  device into notes, with in-app preview.

  such as .txt, .md, and .html), allowing them to be opened directly and converted into notes.

  HTML, for versatile sharing and usage.
