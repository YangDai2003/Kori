[<img alt="Get it on GitHub" src="screenshots/github.png" width="200px">](https://github.com/YangDai2003/Kori/releases)

To balance the account fees of the app store, the app will be sold at a very low price. You can also
get it for free from GitHub. The app itself is no different. Thank you for your support and
understanding.
